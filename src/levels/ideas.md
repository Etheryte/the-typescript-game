# Level ideas

Perhaps just follow the TS book on types?

`any`

`string`, `number` etc?

`[]`

`function foo(): string {}` and `() => string`

`null` and `undefined`

`{ foo: string }` (and perhaps here or later `{ foo?: string }`)

`number | string`

`"foo" | "bar"`

`Pick`, `Exclude`, `Omit` etc

`typeof`?

React stuff?

# Gameplay ideas

Left to right mover like You Must Build A Boat
a-la jump over: any, then only rocks etc
counter fire monster with ice/water spell a-la function onEncounter(enemy: Monster<Fire>) => Spell<Water>

Bottom to top flight shooter scroller
a-la shoot at: any, then only obstacles etc
